# Trial Period

When hiring, we look for specific qualities and skills in our candidates that
can only be observed during the trial period. Skills such as the ability to
figure things out on your own, judgemental skills, decision-making, and async
collaboration are part of our internal culture and what we aim for.

Across the whole engineering, our team operates the following way:  

1. lead engineers contribute to defining business Goals along with the Partners
   and Stakeholders
1. every engineer, who is assigned to the Goal, identifies the Problems stopping
   us from achieving the Goal
1. every engineer assigns themselves one Problem at a time and proposes a solution
   in the form of PR.

The main idea is to make the right contributions to achieve the Goals. All this
process happens async, without making blockers or individuals being spoon-fed
with new assignments. This is what we are expecting from you during your trial
period too. For more details please carefully read Developer Guidelines.

## How the Trial works

Once onboarded in the repository, you won't receive a narrow Problem to resolve.
Instead, you will be assigned to a Goal where you will join forces with our team
members and be responsible for contributing to the Goal. We'll expect you to
define a new Problem and resolve it, or pick from the ones reported by your
peers. Our [Developer Guidelines](./CONTRIBUTING.md) will help you navigate your
trial and follow our team's principles.

## Get started

   following them will result in your contribution being rejected.

   [PRIVATE THREAD](https://github.com/holdex/developers/blob/main/.github/private-thread-instruction-min.png)

   Mark (@MarkCurchin).

1. Align with the Goal you will get assigned to.
1. Create a Problem (issue) or assign yourself to an existing one.
1. Describe shortly your solution and provide an ETA in the comment section.
1. Communicate in your Discord private thread your intentions to resolve a
   problem and paste the GitHub link.
1. Begin solving and follow our [Engineering Guidelines](./CONTRIBUTING.md).
1. Once complete, request review according to our
   [Engineering Guidelines](./CONTRIBUTING.md) and ping Mark in your Discord
   private thread.

## I don't have access to open a PR in the repository. What do I do?

Fork the repository and create a PR using a [Fork Strategy](https://gist.github.com/Chaser324/ce0505fbed06b947d962).

## What is the trial duration?

The trial period can take from 1 to 5 days, which can be extended if necessary.
If the PR is kept stale for a long period without previous notice, it will be
closed automatically.

## Can I get a different task on trial?

No.

## Do I get hired after the trial?

After the trial, your results will undergo a collective verification and
assessment from a board of responsible members. Since we will be in touch, we
will communicate to you personally the results of the trial and the next steps
awaiting.
