# Compensation guide

Compensation principles and the expectation we have from our team members

At Holdex, everybody contributing to the business should be treated and rewarded equitably, regardless of where they come from, how old and `experienced` they are, or what titles they have been assigned. It all may seem essential, but it doesn’t give you superpowers. It’s all about having the [right attitude](https://holdex.io/c/learn/principles) and the positive impact you can make. We established 2 fundamental rules to achieve it:

* Clear incentives . All salaries and bonuses are based on a simple merit system. The more you contribute by independently delivering end results, the more rewards you will receive. Doing the same job at the same level is paid the same regardless of location or other factors.
* Resilient framework . One that’s simple, consistent, and universally adhered to—without exceptions. A framework that can help people grow inside the team and help them understand what is expected from them.

## Our approach

To help everyone on our team understand what is expected of them and where they can improve, we put together a framework decomposed into traits that we regularly track. Not just for developers but for everyone: designers, finance, strategy, partnership, customer relations, etc.

## Looking forward

A startup studio like Holdex has so many processes that we can’t put them all in a framework (although, we’d love that, haha). Some of them are hard to pack or to remember. Others get blurry and overlap constantly. Yet, we managed to add a bit of structure and expand more on our expectations from each level to help you figure out which areas to grow.
