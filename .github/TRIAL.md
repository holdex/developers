# Trial Period
When hiring, we look for specific qualities and skills in our candidates that can only be observed during the trial period. Skills such as the ability to figure things out on your own, judgemental skills, decision-making, and async collaboration are part of our internal culture and what we aim for.

Across the whole engineering, our team operates the following way:  
1. lead engineers contribute to defining business Goals along with the Partners and Stakeholders
2. every engineer, who is assigned to the Goal, identifies the Problems stopping us from achieving the Goal
3. every engineer assigns themself one Problem at a time and proposes a solution in the form of PR.

The main idea is to make the right contributions to achieve the Goals. All this process happens async, without making blockers or individuals being spoon-fed with new assignments. This is what we are expecting from you during your trial period too. For more details please carefully read Developer Guidelines.

## How the Trial works
Once onboarded in the repository, you won't receive a narrow Problem to resolve. Instead, you will be assigned to a Goal where you will join forces with our team members and be responsible for contributing to the Goal. We'll expect you to define a new Problem and resolve it, or pick from the ones reported by your peers. Our [Developer Guidelines](./CONTRIBUTING.md) will help you navigate your trial and follow our team's principles.

## Get started

## I don't have access to open a PR in the repository. What do I do?
Fork the repository and create a PR using a [Fork Strategy](https://gist.github.com/Chaser324/ce0505fbed06b947d962). 

## What is the trial duration?
The trial period can take from 1 to 5 days, which can be extended if necessary. If the PR is kept stale for a long period without previous notice, it will be closed automatically.

## Can I get a different task on trial?
No.

## Do I get hired after the trial?
After the trial, your results will undergo a collective verification and assessment from a board of responsible members. Since we will be in touch, we will communicate to you personally the results of the trial and the next steps awaiting.
