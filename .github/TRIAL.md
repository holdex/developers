# Trial Period
When hiring at Holdex, we look for specific qualities and skills in our candidates that can only be observed during the trial period. Skills such as the ability to figure things out on your own, judgemental skills, decision-making, and async collaboration are part of our internal culture and what we aim for.

From top to bottom, our teams operate the following way: Lead engineers contribute to defining the Goals along with the Partners and Stakeholders. Once defined, everyone on the team looks for the best solutions to achieve those Goals. Individual engineers define the Problems (issues) themselves and propose the solutions as PRs. The main idea is to make the right contributions to achieve the Goals. All of which is happening async, without making blockers or individuals being spoon-fed with new assignments. This is what we are expecting from you during your trial period too.

## How the Trial works
Once onboarded in the repository, you won't receive a narrow Problem to resolve. Instead, you will be assigned to a Goal where you will join forces with our team members and be responsible for contributing to the Goal. We'll expect you to define a new Problem and resolve it, or pick from the ones reported by your peers. Our [Engineering Guidelines](./CONTRIBUTING.md) will help you navigate your trial and follow familiar to our team principles.

## I don't have access to open a PR in the repository. What to do?
Fork the repository and create a PR using a [Fork Strategy](https://gist.github.com/Chaser324/ce0505fbed06b947d962). 

## What is the trial duration?
The trial period can take from 1 to 5 days, which can be extended if necessary. If the PR is kept stale for a long period without previous notice, it will be closed automatically.

## Can I get a different task on trial?
No. 

## Do I get hired after the trial?
After the trial, your results will undergo a collective verification and assessment from a board of responsible members. Since we will be in touch, we will communicate to you personally the results of the trial and the next steps awaiting.
