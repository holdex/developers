## I don't have access to open a PR in the repository. What to do?
Fork the repository and create a PR using a [Fork Strategy](https://gist.github.com/Chaser324/ce0505fbed06b947d962). 

## What is the trial duration?
The trial period can take from 1 to 5 days, which can be extended if necessary. If the PR is kept stale for a long period without previous notice, it will be closed automatically.

## Can I get a different task on trial?
No. 

## Do I get hired after the trial?
After the trial, your results will undergo a collective verification and assessment from a board of responsible members. Since we will be in touch, we will communicate to you personally the results of the trial and the next steps awaiting.
