# Code of Conduct

1. Make sure you are aligned with our Core Values.
2. Ensure the quality of your work. It is a sign of poor ownership and lack of confidence when you expect someone to deal with your incomplete work.
3. Assign yourself to the Problem you are solving so others are aware of it.
4. Don’t use `@mention` when it is not crucial for the person to be notified. Use "reactions" (likes) instead.
5. Leave updates daily to keep things transparent and simple for others.

## Core Values

- “Dream Big” - it's important to set ambitious goals to challenge the status quo. Otherwise, it's not worth it.
- “Do the Right Thing” – if you do something “right” but it is the wrong thing to do, your efforts will be in vain.
- “Keep it Simple” – simplicity is a significant key to success. The most complicated skill is to be simple.
- “Own it with Passion” – we believe in taking ownership and responsibility for our work. We encourage a mindset of accelerated learning as you “figure it out yourself” and the drive to go beyond expectations. We are passionate about what we do and understand that the success of our business is dependent on us.
- “Be Open” – expand your horizons by challenging your beliefs and embracing new knowledge, ideas, and opportunities. See things from the perspective of others, and you may uncover potential missteps and grow in your understanding. Open your mind to learn and grow, strengthening your self-belief. It's not failure that matters, but the ability to get back up after falling.
- “Keep the Focus” – to achieve our team goals, ask, “What is our biggest obstacle?” and focus on the next actionable step. Continuously review our goals to ensure that your actions are aligned. Identify areas of improvement constantly to streamline resources and enhance business efficacy.
