# Our Principles

**We build great things together—fast, smart, and with full ownership.**

## The 6 Rules We Live By

1. **Start with the Goal**  
   Keep the big picture. Break it into clear problems. Solve one at a time.

2. **Own It Like a Founder**  
   No one assigns tasks. You spot problems, claim them, and deliver results.

3. **Ship Daily, Small & Often**  
   No task >4 hours. Finish, push, move on. Momentum beats perfection.

4. **Respect Time—Yours & Others**  
   One team sync/week. Work async. No meetings unless needed.

5. **Wear Many Hats**  
   Code, design, test, write, explore. We grow by doing.

6. **Figure It Out**  
   Research. Read. Ask. Learn fast. No waiting for instructions.
