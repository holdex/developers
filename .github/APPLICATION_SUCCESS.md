## Frequent questions

### Why am I here?
GitHub is our primary tool for team collaboration. From business and down to engineering, we prefer keeping things simple - in a single place. Since you have applied to one of our positions, it only makes sense to keep our instructions, guidelines, and documents related to our job positions in GitHub. Our goal with time is to give you enough initial guidance so that you are fully prepared to join any of our projects. We hope you'll appreciate our efforts and enjoy this journey we've prepared ahead for you.

### Why do I need to participate in the trial?
It's all about the team culture that we care about. Part of this team culture is the individual ability to figure things out, provide the right solutions, display initiative, be honest and transparent, take responsibility, care for details, ability to make the right calls, and much more. All of which can't be assessed unless we collaborate on something together. It's also a good opportunity for you to get the real feeling of working with us and see if it fits your style. We'll understand if it doesn't align with your values and you don't want to participate, just let us know. 

### How to participate in the trial?
Follow the steps outlined in our [short instruction](./TRIAL.md) and it will get you started. 

### Are we having an interview call?
Personal time is more precious. Instead of spending 1 hour of collective time on a "whiteboard" interview, we allow you to focus on what really matters. We usually don't have calls until official onboarding where you get to meet the founders and other team members.

### What benefits do you offer?
1. **We are 100% remote**. Work from anywhere around the world async and ad-hoc. 
1. **Salary in stablecoins**. As early adopters, we are very supportive of blockchain payroll. It is negotiable though.
1. **[PTO](./LEAVE_POLICY.md) and Holidays leave**.
