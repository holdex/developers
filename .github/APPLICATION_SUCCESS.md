## Frequent questions

### Why am I here?
GitHub is our primary tool for team collaboration. From business and down to engineering, we prefer keeping things simple - in a single place. Since you have applied to one of our positions, it only makes sense to keep our instructions, guidelines, and documents related to our job positions in GitHub. Our goal with time is to give you enough initial guidance so that you are fully prepared to join any of our projects. We hope you'll appreciate our efforts and enjoy this journey we've prepared ahead for you.

### Why do I need to participate in the trial?
It's all about the team culture that we care about. Part of this team culture is the individual ability to figure things out, providing the right solutions, displaying initiative, being honest and transparent, taking responsibility, careing for details, ability to make the right calls, and much more. All of which can't be assessed unless we collaborate on something together. It's also a good opportunity for you to get the real feeling of working with us and see if it fits your style. We'll understand if it doesn't align with your values and you don't want to participate, just let us know. 

### How to participate in the trial?
Follow the steps outlined in our [short instruction](https://github.com/holdex/developers/blob/main/.github/TRIAL.md) and it will get you started. 

### Are we having an interview call?
Personal time is more precious. Instead of spending 1 hour of collective time on a "whiteboard" interview, we give you the opportunity to focus on what really matters to you. We usually don't have calls until official onboarding where you get to meet the founders and other team members.

### What benefits Holdex offers?
1. **We are 100% remote**. Work from anywhere around the world async and ad-hoc. 
1. **Salary in stablecoins**. As [early adopters](https://holdex.io/about), we are very supportive of blockchain payroll. It is negotiable though.
1. **[PTO](https://holdex.io/c/learn/leave) and Holidays leave**.
1. Project rotation. Exchange experience by building alongside [industry leaders](https://holdex.io/portfolio).
1. Career growth protocol. Grow skills and contributions to become a Leader or Partner and earn from deals brought in.

### I don't have Discord. Why should I join Holdex there?
Discord is where we communicate with all our team members. We'll reach out personally to you in Discord to keep track of your application progress.
