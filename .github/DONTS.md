## ✅ DOs  
- **Align with Goals**: Keep the big picture in mind and break goals into smaller, actionable tasks for clarity and focus.  
- **Focus on What Matters**: Work on tasks that directly contribute to our goals.  
- **Take Ownership**: Tackle challenges head-on, and if you're stuck, communicate your difficulties with the team.  
- **Overlap Work Hours**: Be available between 1–6 PM HKT daily to collaborate effectively.  
- **Test Thoroughly**: Ensure your work is reliable and well-tested before marking it complete.  
- **Leave Updates**: Share progress frequently through comments or commits, ideally on an hourly basis.  
- **Value Time**: Respect others’ time. Work independently but collaborate when needed. Avoid relying on others for things you can handle yourself.  
- **Wear Many Hats**: Embrace versatility—code, design, test, write, and explore ideas because we're passionate about building great products.  
- **Be Resourceful**: Learn independently by exploring documentation, tutorials, and using tools like AI to find solutions.

- **Engage in Low-Value Work**: Avoid tasks that don't meaningfully contribute to our goals.  
- **Avoid Responsibility**: Take accountability for your tasks and challenges.  
- **Neglect Testing**: Don’t rely on others to test your work for you.
