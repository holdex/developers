## Frequent questions
Q: Will my unused vacation days carry over to the following year?  
A: Unused days can be carried over into the following year. While we encourage you to get out of the office and refresh, we won't penalize you for showing up to work.  

Q: If I leave the company, will I be compensated for unused days?  
A: Yes. You will receive a check compensating you for any unused personal days. Sick days and holidays will not be reimbursed.  
_compensation = monthlyRate * (unusedPtoDays / totalPtoDays)_  

## Requesting time off
1. All requests should be submitted two weeks before time off. 
Otherwise, your request might be rejected.
2. Days off are requested through GitHub issues.
